## PSTs

The PST - pioneers, settlers, townplanners can be added to the map when clicking the PST icons from the WYSIWYG toolbar.  This is grest.  The drawing functionality works perfectly.

I want to be able to edit an existing PST box on the mapCanvas.  The functionality to move exsits and works.  The piece missing is the ability to resize.  I want a RESIZE functionality for existing PST map elements.
