Date: 1 June 2025

## Overview

This document tracks progress on Phase 4A of the OnlineWardleyMaps migration plan, which focuses on updating core component interfaces to use the unified type system directly.

## Component Migration Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MapView | ðŸŸ¨ In Progress | ModernMapView created, needs testing |
| UnifiedMapContent | ï¿½ In Progress | Adapter function definition removed, usages still exist |
| MapComponent | ðŸŸ¨ In Progress | ModernMapComponent initial version created (needs fixes) |
| ComponentText | ï¿½ In Progress | ModernComponentText created (needs interface fixes) |
| MapPipelines | ðŸŸ¥ Not Started | Needs to be migrated to ModernMapPipelines |

## Next Steps

1. Create ModernMapPipelines component
2. Update ModernUnifiedMapContent to use modern components
3. Remove all adapter function usages in ModernUnifiedMapContent

## Completed Tasks

- Initial analysis of adapter functions in ModernUnifiedMapContent
- Removed adapter function definition in ModernUnifiedMapContent
- Created and fixed ModernMapComponent with proper interfaces
- Created and fixed ModernComponentText with proper interfaces
- Created Phase 4A implementation plan

## Issues Identified

- Interface mismatches between legacy and modern components
- Multiple adapter function usages in ModernUnifiedMapContent
- Some component interfaces need updates to support unified types

## Technical Details

The migration is focusing on:
1. Eliminating adapter functions like `adaptUnifiedToMapElement`
2. Updating component interfaces to use `UnifiedComponent` directly
3. Ensuring type-safety throughout the component hierarchy

This progress will be updated as the implementation proceeds.
