# Phase 4B Migration Progress Tracker

## June 1, 2025

### Completed Tasks

1. Fixed bug in ModernUnifiedMapCanvas.tsx
   - Added effect hook to clear mapElementsClicked when mod key is released
   - This fixed the issue with fluid links remaining visible after releasing CMD key

2. Implemented ModernMapPipelines integration
   - Updated ModernUnifiedMapContent to use ModernMapPipelines
   - Removed legacy adapter pattern that was causing `adaptUnifiedToMapElement` errors
   - Simplified props passing to use UnifiedMapElements directly

3. Created modern pipeline components
   - Created ModernPipeline.tsx as a replacement for Pipeline.tsx
   - Created ModernPipelineVersion2.tsx as a replacement for PipelineVersion2.tsx
   - Updated ModernMapPipelines to use these new components

4. Created modern pipeline symbol
   - Created ModernPipelineBoxSymbol.tsx for consistent modern component pattern
   - Ensured proper integration with pipeline components

### Current Status

- ✅ ModernUnifiedMapCanvas.tsx is now handling mod key state correctly for linking
- ✅ ModernMapPipelines.tsx is properly integrated with ModernUnifiedMapContent
- ✅ ModernPipeline and ModernPipelineVersion2 components implemented
- ✅ Build process completes successfully without errors
- ✅ Direct component passing with passComponent() is functioning correctly

### Next Steps

1. Create tests for the new pipeline components:
   - Test ModernPipeline.tsx behavior
   - Test ModernPipelineVersion2.tsx behavior
   - Test ModernMapPipelines.tsx integration

2. Update documentation:
   - Document the new unified component architecture
   - Update user guides with new component behavior

3. Phase 4C planning:
   - Identify remaining components that need modernization
   - Prioritize next set of components to migrate
   - Create implementation plan for Phase 4C

4. Integration testing:
   - Ensure all modern components work together correctly
   - Verify interaction patterns remain consistent
