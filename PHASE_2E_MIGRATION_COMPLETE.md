# PHASE 2E MIGRATION COMPLETED

As of May 31, 2025, Phase 2E of the OnlineWardleyMaps migration plan has been successfully completed. This phase focused on removing the legacy MapElements.ts file and ensuring all code uses the new UnifiedMapElements class.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed legacy MapElements.ts file**

   - Deleted the file from `/frontend/src/MapElements.ts`
   - This file is no longer needed as all functionality has been migrated to `UnifiedMapElements.ts`

2. **Updated wmlandscape exports**
   - Modified `/frontend/wmlandscape/src/index.js` to import and export `UnifiedMapElements` instead of `MapElements`
   - Ensures that external packages using the library get the updated version

## Verification

1. **Build successful** - The Next.js build completes without errors
2. **All tests pass** - 17 test suites with 98 tests are passing
3. **No references to legacy MapElements** - All code now uses the new UnifiedMapElements class

## Phase 2 Migration Complete

With the completion of Phase 2E, the entire Phase 2 migration plan is now finished. The codebase is now using a single, unified data model with consistent types throughout the application.

### Summary of Phase 2 Achievements:

- ✅ Phase 2A: Updated Link Strategies to use UnifiedMapElements
- ✅ Phase 2B: Updated Utilities to use UnifiedMapElements
- ✅ Phase 2C: Updated Components to use UnifiedMapElements
- ✅ Phase 2D: Updated Tests to use UnifiedMapElements
- ✅ Phase 2E: Removed Legacy MapElements.ts file

The application can now operate with a more maintainable, type-safe code structure built around the UnifiedWardleyMap and UnifiedMapElements classes.
