# Phase 4A Implementation Progress Tracker

Date: 1 June 2025

## Overview

This document tracks progress on Phase 4A of the OnlineWardleyMaps migration plan, which focuses on updating core component interfaces to use the unified type system directly.

## Component Migration Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MapView | ðŸŸ¨ In Progress | ModernMapView created, needs testing |
| UnifiedMapContent | ï¿½ In Progress | Adapter function definition removed, usages still exist |
| MapComponent | ðŸŸ¨ In Progress | ModernMapComponent initial version created (needs fixes) |
| ComponentText | ï¿½ In Progress | ModernComponentText created (needs interface fixes) |
| MapPipelines | ðŸŸ¥ Not Started | Needs to be migrated to ModernMapPipelines |

## Next Steps

1. Fix interface issues in ModernComponentText
2. Update ModernMapComponent to use correct interfaces
3. Create ModernMapPipelines component
4. Update ModernUnifiedMapContent to use modern components
5. Remove all adapter function usages

## Completed Tasks

- Initial analysis of adapter functions in ModernUnifiedMapContent
- Removed adapter function definition in ModernUnifiedMapContent
- Created first version of ModernMapComponent (needs fixes)
- Created first version of ModernComponentText (needs fixes)
- Created Phase 4A implementation plan

## Issues Identified

- Interface mismatches between legacy and modern components
- Multiple adapter function usages in ModernUnifiedMapContent
- Some component interfaces need updates to support unified types

## Technical Details

The migration is focusing on:
1. Eliminating adapter functions like `adaptUnifiedToMapElement`
2. Updating component interfaces to use `UnifiedComponent` directly
3. Ensuring type-safety throughout the component hierarchy

This progress will be updated as the implementation proceeds.
