# Implementation

## Core Principles

- Implement the simplest thing that can make it work
- Avoid overengineering or over complicate the implementation
- Avoid large implementation and use the single responsibility principle to decompose
- Upon completion of each task, commit the changes usung git
- Avoid comments, the code should explain itself
- Avoid over testing. Favour fewer, stronger, outside in tests
- When bug fixing, commit often and seek feedback on the fix. If the bug isn't fixed, consider revert the changes and try again, rather than attempting to fix the "fix" itself
