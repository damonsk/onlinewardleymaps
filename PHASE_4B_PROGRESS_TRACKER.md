# Phase 4B Migration Progress Tracker

## June 1, 2025

### Completed Tasks

1. Fixed bug in ModernUnifiedMapCanvas.tsx
   - Added effect hook to clear mapElementsClicked when mod key is released
   - This fixed the issue with fluid links remaining visible after releasing CMD key

2. Implemented ModernMapPipelines integration
   - Updated ModernUnifiedMapContent to use ModernMapPipelines
   - Removed legacy adapter pattern that was causing `adaptUnifiedToMapElement` errors
   - Simplified props passing to use UnifiedMapElements directly

### Current Status

- ✅ ModernUnifiedMapCanvas.tsx is now handling mod key state correctly for linking
- ✅ ModernMapPipelines.tsx is properly integrated with ModernUnifiedMapContent
- ✅ Build process completes successfully without errors
- ✅ Direct component passing with passComponent() is functioning correctly

### Next Steps

1. Create ModernMap* variants for remaining components:
   - ModernPipeline.tsx (replacement for Pipeline.tsx)
   - ModernPipelineVersion2.tsx (replacement for PipelineVersion2.tsx)

2. Update symbols to use unified types directly:
   - Review and update pipeline-related symbols 
   - Ensure proper type definitions throughout

3. Develop comprehensive testing strategy:
   - Create tests for ModernMapPipelines behavior
   - Test fluid linking functionality with mod key

4. Documentation updates:
   - Document the new unified component approach
   - Update migration guides with lessons learned
