# Phase 5: Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

With the completion of Phase 4C, the OnlineWardleyMaps application has been successfully modernized with a unified type system, consistent component interfaces, and direct usage of ModernMapElements throughout the codebase. The next phase focuses on performance optimization, particularly implementing selective re-rendering for components to improve the application's responsiveness and efficiency.

## Objectives

1. Reduce unnecessary re-renders across the component tree
2. Improve interaction responsiveness, especially for large maps
3. Optimize memory usage and reduce GC pauses
4. Maintain type safety and code quality while improving performance

## Performance Issues to Address

### 1. Component Re-rendering

Currently identified issues:
- All components re-render when only one component is modified
- Map state changes trigger cascading re-renders
- Text editor changes cause full map re-renders

### 2. Memory Optimization

- Large maps may cause memory pressure
- Cached component states may be inefficiently stored
- Component memoization may be incomplete or ineffective

### 3. Event Handling Optimization

- Event handlers may be recreated unnecessarily
- Mod key handling may be inefficient
- Mouse move events may cause excessive re-renders

## Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Performance Benchmarking and Analysis

1. **Create Performance Test Maps**
   - Small map (~10 components)
   - Medium map (~50 components)
   - Large map (~200+ components)

2. **Implement Performance Metrics Collection**
   - Component render counts
   - Time to render measurements
   - Memory usage profiling
   - Interaction responsiveness metrics

3. **Analyze Component Rendering Patterns**
   - Identify redundant renders using React DevTools
   - Document component update patterns
   - Measure prop change frequencies

### Stage 2: Component Memoization

1. **Map Component Optimization**
   - Apply `React.memo` with custom equality checks to components
   - Implement stable callback references using `useCallback`
   - Create specialized prop comparison functions

2. **Component Props Optimization**
   - Review and optimize prop structures
   - Implement stable object references
   - Flatten component props where beneficial

3. **Context Optimization**
   - Refine context providers to minimize unnecessary updates
   - Split contexts by update frequency
   - Implement selector pattern for context consumers

### Stage 3: Render Optimization

1. **Implement Virtualized Rendering**
   - Add windowing for large component lists
   - Implement partial rendering for off-screen components
   - Add priority rendering for visible/interactive elements

2. **State Management Refinement**
   - Optimize state updates to minimize cascading effects
   - Implement batched state updates
   - Consider using reducers for complex state logic

3. **Event Handling Optimization**
   - Throttle/debounce high-frequency events
   - Optimize mod key tracking
   - Improve drag event performance

### Stage 4: Testing and Documentation

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure improvements against benchmarks
   - Test on all performance test maps
   - Verify no functional regressions

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document performance best practices
   - Update component API documentation with performance notes
   - Document optimization techniques used

3. **Code Review and Finalization**
   - Ensure code quality and maintainability
   - Clean up any temporary performance monitoring code
   - Prepare final performance report

## Timeline

- **Analysis and Benchmarking**: 1 week
- **Component Memoization**: 1 week
- **Render Optimization**: 2 weeks
- **Testing and Documentation**: 1 week

Total estimated time: 5 weeks

## Success Criteria

1. 50%+ reduction in unnecessary component re-renders
2. Smooth interaction for maps with 200+ elements
3. No functional regressions
4. Maintained type safety and code quality
5. Comprehensive documentation of performance optimizations

## Documentation Deliverables

- Performance benchmarking results
- Component rendering analysis
- Optimization techniques implemented
- Performance best practices guide
- Final performance improvement report
