## Maturity Mapping Example

Notes are generic pieces of text that you can place anywhere on a map.  They can be versatile and allow you to add more context.  

Here is an example of using adding additional context from <a href="https://maturitymapping.com/" target="_blank">Maturity Mapping</a> onto the map.  The evolution axis has been changed to Novel, Emerging, Good and Best.



### Template (copy and paste into your map)
```
// Map setup.
evolution Novel->Emerging->Good->Best
note New to us [0.035, 0.01]
note Not well understood [0.01, 0.01]
note Trying this out [0.035, 0.18]
note Can begin to explain [0.01, 0.18]
note Getting to grips with this [0.035, 0.41]
note Room for improvement [0.01, 0.41]
note Nailed it [0.035, 0.71]
note A practice we've established [0.01, 0.71]

note Unmodeled [0.06, 0.01]
note Divergent [0.06, 0.18]
note Convergent [0.06, 0.41]
